All my source code of the problems that I resolved ro tried to resolve

### A1. Second Hand
MY code consist in verifying a logic link between the two number given in the first line input

**Result :** Success ! (+9 pts)

### B1. Second Hand
A bit special : depending on conditions, it will display possible case with the grid full of tree and "Possible", either not displaying the grid and making the test case "Impossible"

**Final result :** Failed (because of the 3 first test case ^^) (+0 pts)

I did not even tried to solve the others problems (because it was hard)
